Check System Health Status
Problem:
Write a function that checks system health based on CPU, Memory, and Disk Usage. If any usage exceeds 80%, return "ALERT", otherwise return "OK".

Example Input:

system_status = {
    "cpu": 75,
    "memory": 85,
    "disk": 60
}
Expected Output:

"ALERT"
(Since memory is over 80%)
