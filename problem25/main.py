ðŸ§© Problem: Generate All Binary Strings of Length n
Goal: Print all possible binary strings of length n.

âœ… Example:
For n = 2, output should be:

00
01
10
11
ðŸ’¡ Why this is perfect for beginners:
The choices are simple: at each position, you either place 0 or 1.

No need to track visited states or prune anything.

Easy to visualize recursion and backtracking.
