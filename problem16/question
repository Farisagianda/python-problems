1. Dinosaur with the Largest and Smallest Feet
Problem:
Given a CSV file containing dinosaur details (with columns such as "Name", "Foot Length", "Weight", "Diet", etc.), write a script that:

Reads the CSV file.

Finds and prints the details of the dinosaur with the largest foot length.

Finds and prints the details of the dinosaur with the smallest foot length.

2. Filter Dinosaurs by Foot Size Threshold
Problem:
Write a script that:

Accepts a CSV file of dinosaur data.

Allows the user to input a foot length threshold (via command-line argument).

Prints the details of all dinosaurs with a foot length greater than the given threshold (i.e., "big feet" dinosaurs).

3. Group and Compare by Diet
Problem:
Create a script that:

Reads dinosaur data from a CSV file.

Groups the dinosaurs by their diet (e.g., Carnivore, Herbivore, Omnivore).

For each diet group, calculates and prints the average foot length.

Additionally, prints the dinosaur with the maximum foot length in each diet group.

4. Sort and Rank Dinosaurs by Foot Length
Problem:
Develop a script that:

Reads a CSV file containing dinosaur information.

Sorts the dinosaurs by foot length in descending order.

Displays the top N dinosaurs with the largest feet, where N is a parameter provided by the user (using argparse).

5. Interactive Dinosaur Detail Lookup
Problem:
Design a script that:

Reads dinosaur data from a CSV file.

Allows the user to search for a dinosaur by name (or partial name match) via a command-line argument.

Returns and prints all details (including foot length, weight, diet, etc.) for the matching dinosaur(s).
