ðŸ§© Problem: Find the Length of a Linked List

    Goal: Given the head of a singly linked list, return the number of nodes in it.

âœ… Example

If the linked list is:

1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4 â†’ None

Then the answer is 4.
ðŸ’¡ Why itâ€™s a good starter:

    No pointer manipulation.

    Just a loop and a counter.

    Helps you get comfortable with the structure of a linked list.
